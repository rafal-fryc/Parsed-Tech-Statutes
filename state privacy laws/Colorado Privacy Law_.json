      "The ability to harness and use data in positive ways is driving innovation and brings beneficial technologies to society, but it has also created risks to privacy and freedom",
      "The unauthorized disclosure of personal information and loss of privacy can have devastating impacts ranging from financial fraud, identity theft, and unnecessary costs in personal time and finances to destruction of property, harassment, reputational damage, emotional distress, and physical harm",
